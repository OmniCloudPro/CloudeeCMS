# SMTP mailer function

You can use this function as an example to send SMTP emails.

To receive notifications (as a site owner) about new submitted forms, we encourage you to use SNS instead!

If you want to notify users about a successfully submitted form, you should configure this mailer function to send emails using your custom domain. 

The mailer function must be configured to listen to an SQS queue.
